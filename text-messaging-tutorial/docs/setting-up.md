# Setting up a campaign

## Introduction to TextIt

The tool we'll be using to set up our text message campaign is called TextIt. TextIt is build by a company called [Nyaruka](http://nyaruka.com/), based in Kigali, Rwanda.

TextIt allows you to visually build interactive text message campaigns. You don't need a programmer start sending texts. Anyone with a bit of training to set up and administer a campaign.

## Testing your campaign

TextIt has a [built in simulator](http://feedback.textit.in/knowledgebase/articles/776505-using-the-simulator). You can use it to see how messages will appear on a phone, right in your browser.

After you test using the simulator, it's wise to test on a real phone as well. This is a good opportunity to confirm that everything's working, and catch last minute typos. [Instructions on sending it to yourself]
