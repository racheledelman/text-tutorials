We are going to focus on two tools that have worked well for us because they are inexpensive, have good customer support, and allow people without programming knowledge to use them. \n\n\nThese two tools are Twilio and TextIt. Together, they allow you to send text messages at the push of a button. You can think of them like a car: Twilio works as the engine, powering your messages without being seen once you set it up. TextIt is the dashboard that you use to steer and adjust your settings.\n\n\nFollow along step by step here to set them up for yourself. Note: these instructions are accurate as of October 2016.\n\n\nIntroduction to Twilio\n\n\nAs your first step, you\u2019ll need to set up a Twilio account. You won\u2019t need to interact with this account much.\n\n\n\n\nGo to Twilio.com\n\n\nClick \u2018Sign up\u2019 or \u2018Get a free API key\u2019\n\n\nFill out the information of the person who will be administering this account.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to fill out the second half of the form, but you can use the following settings if you\u2019d like to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you\u2019ll be asked for a phone number to verify the account. Don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t the number you\u2019ll be sending texts from. Use your cell phone.\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve verified your account, you\u2019ll be taken to the Console Dashboard. Here you\u2019ll find your Account SID and Auth Token. Take note of these, you\u2019ll need them for TextIt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs your last step with Twilio, you\u2019ll need to add money to your account. You\u2019re currently in a free trial mode, but to send texts, you\u2019ll need to add funds. Click on the \u201cUpgrade\u201d link. You can start with just $20.\n\n\nIf your organization is a 501(c)3 non-profit or certified B-Corp, you may be eligible for free or discounted credits through \nTwilio.org\n. Apply through their website after you have followed the steps above to create your account! \n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re done setting up Twilio. Now it\u2019s time to set up your TextIt account.\n\n\nIntroduction to TextIt\n\n\nThe tool we'll be using to set up our text message campaign is called TextIt. TextIt is build by a company called \nNyaruka\n, based in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\n\nTextIt allows you to visually build interactive text message campaigns. You don't need to be a programmer start sending texts. Anyone with a bit of training can set up and administer a campaign. So let\u2019s get started!\n\n\n\n\nGo to textit.in\n\n\nEnter your email address in the \u201cTry it for Free\u201d field. \n\n\nCreate an account with your administrator\u2019s information.\n\n\nClick on the \u201cChannels\u201d link in the navigation bar.\n\n\nClick the \u201cConnect Twilio\u201d button. TextIt makes it easy to integrate with Twilio.\n\n\nEnter the SID and Account Token from your Twilo account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[get phone number]\n\n\n[Add credits]\n\n\nRemember to keep track of your log-in credentials. You\u2019ll want to share it with anyone who will be sending out messages in the future.\n\n\n\n\nNext, learn more about TextIt by watching this quick video. You can always learn more by watching their \ntraining videos\n and reading their \ncomprehensive documentation\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing TextIt\n from \nTextIt\n on \nVimeo\n.\n\n\nCreating flows in TextIt\n\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to set up a test campaign. TextIt calls each diagram of a text campaign a \u201cFlow.\u201d Click from the homepage to see sample flows and get a feel for the structure. Then follow the steps below to set up a new flow:\n\n\n\n\nClick to create a new Flow\n\n\nGive your Flow a name - for example, \u201cMay 2016 Appointment Reminders\u201d \n\n\nKeep the \u2018Keyword Triggers\u2019 field blank \n\n\nChange the \u2018Remove Expired Contacts\u2019 option to \u201cNever\u201d \n\n\nKeep it as \u201cRun flow over messaging\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNow you can create your first message. Enter the text for what you want to send as the first text message people receive (we\u2019ll go over best practices later). Then, follow the same steps as you saw in the Introduction Video to build your whole flow.\n\n\nOne trick: you can use set up alerts for yourself when someone replies or unsubscribes. Just add a new message for people who arrive at a certain point of your flow and select the option to send an SMS or email to someone else.\n\n\n\n\nOur team set alerts to let us know when someone responded to a text we sent them, so we knew to log in to TextIt and personally respond to their questions.\n\n\nTesting your campaign\n\n\nTextIt has a \nbuilt in simulator\n. You can use it to see how messages will appear on a phone, right in your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you test using the simulator, it's wise to test on a real phone as well. This is a good opportunity to confirm that everything's working, and catch last minute typos. To do that, you will add your own number as an option on the Contacts page and then select your contact when starting a flow.\n\n\nFinal set up\n\n\nBefore logging out of TextIt, you will want to connect your Twilio and TextIt accounts so you can send text messages with a real phone number. Do that by clicking the \nChannels option\n on TextIt and following the instructions to connect your Twilio account.",

You can also read \nTextIt's suggestions\n for message content.\n\n\nHIPAA\n\n\n[content to come]\n\n\nCharacter limit\n\n\nEach text message is limited to 160 characters. That includes letters, punctuation, and spaces. You can use a website like \nCharacter Count Tool\n to help you stick to this limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by \nCharacter Count Tool\n\n\nIdentify yourself\n\n\nYour text message will be coming from a number without a name attached, so you'll need to identify yourself in the body of the message. This takes up valuable characters, but it's important to do with each message so that recipients know who's texting them. Starting your message with \"KCMO Health Dept:\" is an example.\n\n\nMultiple messages\n\n\nIf you can't fit your message in a single text, you can also send a series of messages. Unfortunately, they don't always arrive in the correct order. It's a good idea to number your messages if they're part of a series, eg: (1/2), (2/2).\n\n\nFrom a recipient's perspective, multiple messages can sometimes feel excessive or overwhelming. Also, remember each message has its own financial cost. Only send multiple messages when you need to.\n\n\nAbbreviations\n\n\nIt's common to save space in text messages by using abbreviations. However, the meaning of abbreviations isn't always universally understood. We recommend you use abbreviations sparingly.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nYou can include links in your messages. This is a great way to direct people to more information, but remember that not everyone has a data plan or access to wifi.\n\n\nRemember, they'll be opening the links on their phone. Are you linking to a mobile-friendly website that can easily be read on a phone?\n\n\nPhone numbers\n\n\nMake sure you format any phone numbers correctly so that recipients can click to call (for example, 555-555-5555).\n\n\nIf you include a phone number, make sure the people in charge of answering that phone know you're directing people to them!\n\n\nUnsubscribe\n\n\nYou're \nlegally required\n to give recipients a way to unsubscribe from your text messages. Luckily, TextIt has this feature built in. Anyone who replies with the word \"stop\" will be automatically removed from your flow. Not every recipient will know about this feature, so it's best to include instructions in your message. A good example is \"Text STOP to unsubscribe\".\n\n\n[include photo]\n\n\nKeywords\n\n\n[content to come]\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\nYou can run the same campaign in multiple languages. If you have prefered language data about your recipients, you can sort people into different language groups.\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nEven simple messages can have different meanings to different people. One easy way to make sure your meaning is clear is to test it with different people. Show your message to a few people who aren't working on the project. Ask them to tell you what it's saying in their own words. If any of them misinterpret it, consider rewording.\n\n\nTextIt has some additional \ntesting suggestions\n here.",
