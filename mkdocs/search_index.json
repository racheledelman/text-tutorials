You can also read \nTextIt's suggestions\n for message content.\n\n\nCharacter limit\n\n\nEach text message is limited to 160 characters. That includes letters, punctuation, and spaces. You can use a website like \nCharacter Count Tool\n to help you stick to this limit.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by \nCharacter Count Tool\n\n\nIdentify yourself\n\n\nYour text message will be coming from a number without a name attached, so you'll need to identify yourself in the body of the message. This takes up valuable characters, but it's important to do with each message so that recipients know who's texting them. Starting your message with \"KCMO Health Dept:\" is an example.\n\n\nMultiple messages\n\n\nIf you can't fit your message in a single text, you can also send a series of messages. Unfortunately, they don't always arrive in the correct order. It's a good idea to number your messages if they're part of a series, eg: (1/2), (2/2).\n\n\nFrom a recipient's perspective, multiple messages can sometimes feel excessive or overwhelming. Use them cautiously. Only send them when you need to.\n\n\nAbbreviations\n\n\nIt's common to save space in text messages by using abbreviations. However, the meaning of abbreviations isn't always universally understood. We recommend you use abbreviations sparingly.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nYou can include links in your messages. This is a great way to direct people to more information, but remember that not everyone has a data plan or access to wifi.\n\n\nRemember, they'll be opening the links on their phone. Are you linking to a mobile-friendly website that can easily be read on a phone?\n\n\nPhone numbers\n\n\nMake sure you format any phone numbers correctly so that recipients can click to call (for example, 555-555-5555).\n\n\nIf you include a phone number, make sure the people in charge of answering that phone know you're directing people to them!\n\n\nUnsubscribe\n\n\nYou're \nlegally required\n to give recipients a way to unsubscribe from your text messages. Luckily, TextIt has this feature built in. Anyone who replies with the word \"stop\" will be automatically EXPLAIN HERE. Not every recipeient will know about this feature, so it's best to include instructions in your message. A good example is \"Text STOP to unsubscribe\"\n\n\n[include photo]\n\n\nKeywords\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\nYou can run the same campaign in multiple languages. If you have prefered language data about your recipients, you can sort people into different language groups.\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nEven simple messages can have different meanings to different people. One easy way to make sure your meaning is clear is to test it with different people. Show your message to a few people who aren't working on the project. Ask them to tell you what it's saying in their own words. If any of them misinterpret it, consider rewording.\n\n\nTextIt has some additional \ntesting suggestions\n here.",
